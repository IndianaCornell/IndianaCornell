## 👋 Hi :)

I'm an open-minded learner passionate about front-end development.  
Currently studying programming at **Neoversity GoIT** and always improving my skills through hands-on practice and team projects.

This is my **educational GitHub page**, where I document my progress and share the projects I build during training.
